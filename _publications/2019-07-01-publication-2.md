  <h3>Abstract</h3>
  <p>The paper reviews the status of glacier mapping with special reference to the Indian Himalaya. The review provides information on various satellite remote sensing data interpretation methods used with special emphasis laid on recent semi-automated algorithms used for glacier and debris-cover mapping, along with their limitations and challenges. Further, the pragmatic solutions on offer are discussed, and the emerging areas of glacier mapping research are highlighted. The review also touches â€“ contribution of Survey of India (SOI) and Geological Survey of India (GSI) in the glacier mapping. Finally, it discusses the wider range of spatial and spectral domains in which remote sensing data helps to inventories glaciers. The review also identifies gaps in using the latest techniques like Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and machine learning algorithms to improvise on the ongoing efforts. At last, the review provides an exhaustive list of references on glacier mapping from the Indian Himalaya as benefit to readers.</p>
