I am currently a Postdoctoral Research Associate at the University of Arizona, working on a NASA-funded urban flood mapping project. My research focuses on leveraging Earth observation foundation models and data fusion-capable transformer architectures to enhance flood inundation mapping in complex environments.Previously, as a Postdoctoral Researcher at The Ohio State University, I developed robust Earth observation methods for large-scale mapping of potential natural (gold) hydrogen sites globally. Using multisource remote sensing data and deep learning, we successfully generated the first-ever global dataset of potential hydrogen sites, which holds significant promise for renewable energy applications and climate change mitigation.

I earned a bi-nationally supervised Doctoral Degree from the Academy of Scientific and Innovative Research and the German Aerospace Center (DLR), Germany. My Ph.D. research focused on developing deep-learning frameworks for mapping glaciers and glacial lakes in the Himalayas, modeling glacial lake outburst floods, and estimating long-term glacier velocities. My broader research interests lie at the intersection of computer vision, remote sensing, and Earth observation, with a particular focus on assessing current and future risks in water resources. My goal is to develop robust Earth observation solutions that map complex Earth features and processes, generating reliable long-term datasets to enhance our understanding of spatio-temporal changes. I hold multiple certifications in Python, Machine Learning, and Linux for scientific computing. I am proficient in remote sensing, machine learning, foundational models, Transformers, Microsoft Office, and data management. Passionate about environmental and social sustainability, I aim to apply my skills and expertise to tackle global challenges.
